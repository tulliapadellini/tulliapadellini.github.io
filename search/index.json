As opposed to previous studies (in and outside the UK) that were based on large spatial units and critically neglected the high spatial variability of pollutants (and resulted in poor adjustment for confounders), we focused on very high resolution geographical units, the 32.844 Lower level super output areas (LSOAs) of England. We downscaled deaths data available at coarser geographical resolution matching the age-sex-ethincity structure of the deaths to that of the smaller areas, and we performed the analysis using a log linear model. In addition to adjusting for confounders related to socio-economic status, metereology, disease progression, health status, we included a random effect in order to account for the spatial autocorrelation of the data.\nOur result suggest that while there is a clear effect of long term exposure to airpollution on covid mortality in the unadjusted model, when we include the confounders the effect become negligible (and not statistically significant).\n Long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality in England: a hierarchical spatial analysis  Quantile Regression for Discrete Data with Haavard Rue\nQuantile regression is concerned with modeling the conditional quantile of the response distribution as opposed to the more common conditional mean. This is especially of interest when we are interested in the determinants of extreme values of the phenomenon of interest.\nIn a Bayesian framework, Quantile regression models have typically been fitted exploiting a working likelihood rather than the true generating one. We explore the case when a generative model is available for the response variable and quantile regression can be considered as an extension of GLM where the link function connects the linear predictor to the quantiles of interest rather than to the conditional mean.\nFor discrete distributions like the Poission, Binomial and the Negative Binomial, however, this approach is not viable. It is not possible to link the linear predictor directly to the quantile of interest, since the quantile function is not bijective. We argue to use a continuous model-aware interpolation of the quantile function, allowing for proper quantile inference while retaining model interpretation.\nAmong the advantages of our approach, we stress that it allows for proper uncertainty quantification and it mitigates the issue of quantile crossing. Moreover we show how our formulation makes it easy to extend quantile regression method to the context of disease mapping.\n Model-aware Quantile Regression for Discrete Data  Topological Data Analysis with Pierpaolo Brutti\nTopological data analysis (TDA) is a new and expanding branch of statistics devoted to recovering the shape of the data in terms of connectivity structure. As it describes very complex objects using easily interpretable features such as loops and voids, TDA has shown to be a useful way to characterize data. From a statistical standpoint, a characterization based on connectivity yields relevant information: connected components correspond to clusters, loops represent periodic structures while higher dimensional voids encode more complex dependencies.\nThere are two different problems to be tackled in TDA: learning the topology and learning with topology. In the first case we are interested in the unknown topological structure per se, as it may be critical in understanding the underlying mechanism generating the data. In the second class of problems we investigate whether topological features can be used alternatively or jointly with more traditional summaries of the data in order to improve performance of statistical methods.\nLearning with topology: Supervised Learning with Kernels Since topological summaries, most noticeably the Persistence Diagram, are typically defined in complex spaces, we adopt a kernel approach to translate them into more familiar vector spaces. We define a topological exponential kernel, we characterize it, and we show that, despite not being positive semi-definite, it can be successfully used in regression and classification tasks.\n Supervised Learning with Indefinite Topological Kernels  Learning the topology: Multiscale Persistent Homology We focus on the case of continuously varying families of objects, which comprises most of the situations where our object of interest is available at multiple resolutions, such as multidimensional time series (available at multiple time point) or kernel density estimators (that vary depending on the bandwidth parameter). This is a challenging yet common framework in statistics, where scale dependent tools arealready almost ubiquitous (smoothers being the most trivial example of it), and are destined to become even more frequent. We define thePersistence Flamelet, a multiscale version of one of the most populartool in TDA, the Persistence Landscape. We examine its theoretical properties and we showits performance as both an exploratory and inferential tool.\n Persistence Flamelets: multiscale Persistent Homology for kernel density exploration  Other Projects  Sparse Canonical Correlation analysis Wasserstein Consensus for sample size determination Object oriented conditional inference trees  ","href":"/research/","title":"Research"},{"content":"Selected Talks\n","href":"/talks/","title":"Talks"},{"content":"[2019]\nEuropean Meeting of Statisticians \u0026ndash; July, Palermo (IT)\nPersistent homology for kernel density exploration\n Networking IBS Regions \u0026ndash; July, Naples (IT) [best oral presentation award - slides]\nWasserstein Consensus for Bayesian Sample Size Determinations\n CRONOS meeting \u0026ndash; April, Limassol (CY) [talk]\nTopological low dimensional learning of high dimensional time series\n [2018]\nCMS-Statistics \u0026ndash; December, Pisa (IT) [talk]\nTopological Invariants for high-dimensional Time Series\n KAUST Statistics Workshop \u0026ndash; November, Thuwal (KSA) [poster]\nPredicting Dengue Epidemics in Brazil using Quantile Regression\n ISBA World Meeting \u0026ndash; June, Edinburgh (UK) [poster]\nBayesian Quantile Regression for Discrete Data\n Riunione Scientifica SIS \u0026ndash; June, Palermo (IT) [talk]\nIndefinite Topological Kernels\n Start-UP Research follow UP \u0026ndash; June, Palermo (IT) [talk]\nHierarchical Graphical Model for learning about functional network determinants\n Young Researcher Memotef \u0026ndash; April, Rome (IT) [talk]\nBayesian Quantile Regression for Discrete Data\n [2017]\nKAUST Statistics Workshop \u0026ndash; November, Thuwal (KSA) [poster]\nBayesian Quantile Regression for Discrete Data\n Riunione Intermedia SIS \u0026ndash; June, Firenze (IT) [best poster award]\nTopological summaries for Time-Varying Data\n IBS - Channel Section \u0026ndash; April, Hasselt (BE) [talk]\nTopological Data Analysis for Activity Recognition\n [2016]\nRiunione Scientifica SIS \u0026ndash; June, Fisciano (IT) [talk]\nTopological signatures for classification\n","href":"/talks/","title":"Talks"},{"content":"Coming soon\n","href":"/teaching/","title":"Teaching"},{"content":"","href":"/docs/","title":"Docs"},{"content":"website is still a work in progress, things may not be where they are supposed to - yet!\n","href":"/docs/wip/","title":"Work in Progress"},{"content":"","href":"/docs/mrc-talk/","title":"pflamelet is on CRAN"},{"content":"","href":"/docs/copyofcomments-support/","title":"Talk for the MRC Centre for Environment and Health"},{"content":"","href":"/docs/comments-support/","title":"COVID + Airpollution is in press"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/muniftanjim/","title":"muniftanjim"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/config/","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/og/","title":"Opengraph"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"}]
