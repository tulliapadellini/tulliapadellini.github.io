      <description>I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate in the Environment and Health Statistics Group of Imperial College London. I am working with Marta Blangiardo and Fred Piel on methods to incorporate spatial uncertainty in hierarchical models, with a special focus on applications in epidemiology and environmental statistics.
At the moment I am also part of the Statistical Modelling Laboratory set up by the Royal Statistical Society and the Alan Turing Institute to support the Joint Biosecurity Center COVID-19 response.</description>

      <description>kernelTDA with Francesco Palini &amp;amp; Pierpaolo Brutti
Tools for Statistical Learning with Topological Summaries. It focuses on Kernel methods for Topological Data Analysis, implementing the most famous Kernel functions defined on the space of Persistence Diagrams and a solver for SVM with indefinite kernels (or SVM in Reproducible Kernel Krein Space) to exploit them. Additionally it provides an R interface to the C++ library HERA, which allows to efficently compute Wasserstein distances between Persistence Diagrams.</description>

      <description>My fear of commitment resulted in me studying many unrelated things.
COVID19 and Airpollution with Garyfallos Konstantinoudis, Marta Blangiardo, Bethan Davies, James Bennet and Majid Ezzati
As there has been much discussion on the role played by air-pollution on COVID19 outcomes, we examined the effect of long term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 on COVID19 deaths in England. As opposed to previous studies (in and outside the UK) that were based on large spatial units and critically neglected the high spatial variability of pollutants (and resulted in poor adjustment for confounders), we focused on very high resolution geographical units, the 32.</description>
